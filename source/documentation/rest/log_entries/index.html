                      <caption>PagerDuty keeps a log of all the events that happen to an incident. The following APIs provide fine-grained access to this incident log entry data to give you more insight into how your team or organization is handling your incidents. Log entry data includes details about the event(s) that triggered the incident, who was notified and when, how they were notified, and who acknowledged or resolved it, amongst a few other things.</caption>
